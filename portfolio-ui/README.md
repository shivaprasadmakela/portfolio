## 🛠️ The Magic Spells (Tech Stack)

I use these tools to build things that (mostly) work on the first try:

- ⚛️ **React** - My favorite frontend Lego set.
- 🎨 **Three.js / React Three Fiber** - Making things 3D because 2D is so 1999.
- 🎭 **Framer Motion** - Adding "The Smoothness" to everything.
- ⚡ **Vite** - Because waiting for builds is boring.
- 🟦 **TypeScript** - Helping me catch my own typos since day one.

## 🌟 Featured "Lab Experiments"

1.  **[Chat App! #TalkNow](https://talknow-link.vercel.app/)** - Speak your mind without the commitment of an account. 🗨️
2.  **[FLAMES Fun](https://flames-fun.vercel.app/)** - Helping people decide their future relationships since... well, whenever I finished this. ❤️
3.  **[Integrated Door](https://integrated-door.vercel.app)** - A doorway to a very cool landing page. 🚪
