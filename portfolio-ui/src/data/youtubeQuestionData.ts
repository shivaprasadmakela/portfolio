### ✅ Example (Beginner Friendly)

Hi, my name is **Shiva**. I am a self-taught Frontend / Full-Stack developer.  
I have worked on projects like a **To-Do App and a Job Portal**, where I built features like authentication, CRUD operations, responsive UI, and API integrations.

I mainly work with **HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React**, and I am currently improving my backend skills with **Node.js & SQL**.  

I enjoy solving real-world problems and learning new tools.  
I’m looking for a role where I can contribute, learn from a strong team, and grow as a developer.
